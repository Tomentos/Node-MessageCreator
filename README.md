# Node Message Creator

This is a simple and small Web Based tool, with which you can create shareable messages and send them to other people.

The messages are embedded in links which, upon opening, display the message with some additional options that can be chosen during creation.

## General Information

This website is using a free to use HTML / CSS Template I created alongside the development of this app. It is awailable for free on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Tomentos).

This is a part of my website. If you are interested in seeing this in action before downloading / using it somewhere else, you can test it [here](https://www.tomentos.com).

## Requirements
You need NodeJS running on your system. I reccomend the latest LTS release. You can download NodeJS on the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You also need all the dependencies for this project. When downloading the repository, all dependencies are already included.<br>But if you need to reinstall them or are missing them, you can install them by opening a command line in the project folder and executing `npm i` to start the installation.<br>If you prefer using a different way of installing the modules, such as yarn, you can install them by executing `yarn` in the command line.

## Download

You can download the latest release of this app on the [release page of this repository](https://github.com/Tomentos/Node-MessageCreator/releases).

All the dependencies are included in the download. If you, for some reason, need to reinstall them, please refer to [the Requirement section](https://github.com/Tomentos/Node-MessageCreator#Requirements).

## Usage

All you need to do to start the app is opening a command line iin the project folder and executing `npm start`.

This will make the website available on the port 3000.<br>You will be able to open it on `localhost:3000`.

## Morality

Messages sent through this app are not always meant to be serious and should generally be taken with a grain of salt. They are not meant to insult and injur any other individual. Therefore, a disclaimer will always be present when recieving a message.
